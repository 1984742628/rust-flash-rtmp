### Transport Layer
- [ ] Create Transport trait with methods (send, receive, connect, disconnect)
- [ ] Implement default transport layers (e.g., TCP, unbounded channels)
- [ ] Design for extensibility of custom transport mechanisms

### RTMP Protocol Implementation
- [ ] Implement NetConnectionContext for RTMP connection management
- [ ] Implement RTMP handshake process:
  - [ ] C0, C1, S0, S1, S2, C2 messages
  - [ ] Implement the new handshaking process since FP 9.0
- [ ] Implement message handling for RTMP messages:
  - [ ] ControlMessages
  - [ ] CommandMessages
  - [ ] DataMessages
- [ ] Develop a transaction system for RTMP commands
- [ ] Handle timestamp wrapping around

### ActionScript Classes
- [ ] Create Rust structs/enums matching ActionScript classes:
  - [ ] NetConnection
  - [ ] NetStream
  - [ ] SharedObject
- [ ] Implement methods/properties for ActionScript behavior

### Feature Extensions
- [ ] Plan and implement flavors of RTMP (e.g., RTMPT, RTMPS)
- [ ] Integrate advanced features (e.g., security, encryption, custom extensions)

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for each component
- [ ] Write integration tests for full protocol stack

### Documentation
- [ ] Document API with usage examples
- [ ] Document RTMP protocol implementation and configuration

### Example Applications
- [ ] Create sample applications or tests to demonstrate usage
